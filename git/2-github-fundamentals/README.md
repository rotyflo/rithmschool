## Exercises

<h3>Part I</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s start by taking a bit of time to practice the git workflow below. It is so valuable to just practice this workflow a couple times, since you will most likely doing it professionally as well as in your individual projects and open source contributions. Here are some things to do.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a local repository and add and commit some files</li>
<li>Create a remote repository and push your code from the local repo to the remote</li>
<li>Fork the repo <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rithmschool/git_practice" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/rithmschool/git_practice</a> - clone it and submit a pull request</li>
<li>Create a new branch locally and push it to GitHub</li>
<li>Submit a pull request with your new branch against the <code>master</code> branch on the <code>git_practice</code> repo.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Part II - Command Line Murder Mystery</h3>

<p>If you have gone through our Terminal and UNIX course, take the time to combine your knowledge of the Terminal, Git, and GitHub to complete a murder mystery! You can find the exercises <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/veltman/clmystery" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Fork and clone the repository and try to solve the mystery!</p>
